# INFO 1040 Code

##### Page 5

One of the courses I am enrolled in this semester is INFO 1040. For me it is the most challenging class I have.
This is the first time I have interacted with Python. It's a struggle, but I'm glad to be learning.
Here is the code from my program I did for the Improved Cylinder Volume Calculation:
```py
from math import pi

#Matthew Nefzger's Improve upon Calculate the Volume of a Cylinder Challenge.

def get_radius_from_user():
    while True:
        try:
            radius = float(input("What is the radius? "))
            if (radius < 0):
                continue
            break
        except ValueError:
            return radius

def get_height_from_user():
    while True:
        try:
            height = float(input("What is the height? "))
            if height < 0:
                continue
            break
        except ValueError:
            return height

def get_positive_value_from_user(prompt):
    while True:
        try:
            value = float(input(prompt))
            if value < 0:
                print("The value you have entered is less than 0. Please enter a number that is greater than 0.")
                continue
            break
        except Exception as e:
            print("Only numerical values are valid. Plus enter a number that is greater than 0.")
        
    return value

def calculate_cylinder_volume(radius, height):
    volume = pi * radius**2 * height
    return volume

def generate_report(radius, height, volume):
    print("A cylinder of radius =", radius, "and height =", height, "has a volume of", volume)

def main():
    radius = get_positive_value_from_user("What is the radius?")
    height = get_positive_value_from_user("What is the height?")
    volume = calculate_cylinder_volume(radius, height)
    generate_report(radius, height, volume)

another_calculation = 'y'
while another_calculation == "y":
    # get input from user
    # perform the calculation
    # output the result
    main()
    another_calculation = input("Do you want to perform another calculation? (y/n): ")
```
