# Video Games

##### Page 2

I am a huge video game nerd. When I was kid, I played games on the [NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System), [SNES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System), and [Sega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Genesis). 
Eventually I got into PC games and that has been my primary platform since.
There are a variety of genres I enjoy such as [MMORPGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game), [RTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy), and [survival games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_game). 

Some of my favorites from NES/SNES/Sega include:
* Super Mario World
* Sonic the Hedgehog
* The Legend of Zelda series
* The Lost Vikings

Some of my favorites I played on PC are:
* EverQuest
* World of Warcraft
* Warcraft 3

My favorite games of all time, in order:
1. Age of Empires II
2. Conan Exiles
3. Assassin's Creed Odyssey
