# Cats

##### Page 1

I am a _crazy_ cat man. I have four cats! Their names are **Romeo**, **Benny**, **Presley**, and **Elsa**. 
The first two are my buddies; they come hang out in my room every day. 
I keep my door closed at night, so when I open my door in the morning **Romeo** runs right past me and straight to the window.
**Benny**, however, will jump up on my lap when I'm at my desk. He's a lap cat--as in he runs laps instead of laying down. 
They're both a little high maintenance. The other two prefer to see me as little as possible. I _love_ my cats.
