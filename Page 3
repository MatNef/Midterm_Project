# The Lord of the Rings

##### Page 3

The Lord of the Rings are my favorite films; _The Hobbit_ is my favorite book. 
The order of the films (and books) are _The Fellowship of the Ring_, _The Two Towers_, and _The Return of the King_.
My personal favorite in the trilogy is _The Two Towers_ because of the Ents.
There is something satisfying about nature fighting back against the destruction of the earth. 
**J.R.R. Tolkien** had great respect for nature and horses. The influence is apparent in the books, but also the films.
_The Hobbit_ was published in 1937; the trilogy was published in 1954 and 1955.
