# Geology - El Diablo

##### Page 4

Currently I am enrolled in 1050 Geology. A month or so ago, the focus of a module was volcanoes.
During that time, a volcano was showing activity on the Canary Islands (owned by Spain) off the coast of Africa.
Here is an image of the volcano erupting [mafic lava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava#:~:text=pyroxene%20phenocrysts.%5B20%5D-,Mafic%20lava,rather%20similar%20to%20entrail-type%20pahoehoe%20lavas%20on%20land.%5B23%5D,-Ultramafic%20lava), courtesy of [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/science-africa-europe-spain-earthquakes-7cad8d28e59501450dd53334c824ea4f).

Volcanoes tend to appear in clusters, so there are a few other volcanoes on the islands. 
One in particular is dormant. A restaurant named [El Diablo](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/el-diablo-restaurant) grills meat using heat from the lava.
This is definitely on my bucket list! Although, I feel bad for the chef on duty the day the dormant volcano awakens.
Just a reminder that dormant is not the same as extinct! Dormant simply means it is not currently active.
